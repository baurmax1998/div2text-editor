# div2text-editor
A JQuery plugin that makes a div to a usable Editor 4 text. 
Just like a textarea with the opportunity to insert html features.
What does the plugin:
1. makes the div editable
2. set 4 as tab size 
3. set that \t \n ... matter
4. disable spellcheck
5. tab insert tab and doesn´t leave the div
6. enter insert \n and doesn´t create new div or br

In my opinion this removes all the bad thigs from editable div´s and makes them usable.
